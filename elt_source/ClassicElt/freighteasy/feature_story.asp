                                            <strong>Jay’s Story</strong></p>
                                        <p class="scenario">
                                            Business has been going well lately for Jay, and he has some extra cash burning
                                            a hole in his pocket. Jay decides to invest some money back into his company by
                                            buying some new computers for his employees. After spending most of his morning
                                            setting up the computers and installing Windows, his office gets back to business
                                            making shipments. But, there’s a problem. When Jay installed the new computers,
                                            he was left with the windows default settings for network security. These settings
                                            are keeping FreightEasy from working correctly.</p>
                                        <p class="scenario">
                                            Although there is a quick and simple fix for this issue, Jay may feel more comfortable
                                            with someone to help walk him through the process. As a member of FreightEasy, Jay
                                            will never get a feeling of being stranded. We are always just a phone call or email
                                            away. And he does not have to pay us any extra in order for us to care about his
                                            concern.</p>
                                        <p class="scenario">
                                            So, Jay picks up the phone and calls us. Once he describes his situation, we connect
                                            him with someone that can help him best. In a matter of minutes, we walk Jay through
                                            the solution and he’s back in business.</p>

                                            Jay used to use multiple systems to perform Freight Forwarding tasks. He entered
                                            data into one application only to switch to another to finish his invoicing and
                                            accounting. These extra steps not only meant extra work, but extra mistakes too.</p>
                                        <p class="scenario">
                                            Now, Jay uses FreightEasy. He creates shipments, enters the charges, invoices, and
                                            knows that all his data is saved for later accounting tasks and reporting. It’s
                                            that simple. The thing Jay likes most about this process is that FreightEasy’s accounting
                                            system was made from the ground up especially for Freight Forwarding. He can view
                                            reports by HAWB, by Ocean Export, and many other industry-specific categories. He
                                            can also create Arrival Notices while invoicing at the same time. Jay knows that
                                            the system is robust enough to handle the accounting for his whole business and
                                            he doesn’t have to look elsewhere come March.

                                            feel much newer. Jay had grown used to up-to-date software like Microsoft Office,
                                            which worked well, looked sleek, and took advantage of the newest technology. He
                                            didn’t see why his Freight Forwarding System had to be any different.</p>
                                        <p class="scenario">
                                            When Jay found FreightEasy, he found a system that could stand up next to all his
                                            other modern software and not look or feel out of place. Jay now completes shipments
                                            easier than ever, trains new employees faster than ever, and rests assured that
                                            he has the newest software on the market.

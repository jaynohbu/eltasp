                                FreightEasy requires no software installations. Software installations are costly,

                                also require on-going maintenance and upgrades. Sometimes installed software can
                                cause conflicts and create problems, hurting your bottom line. FreightEasy eliminates
                                these potential issues.

                                With traditional LAN based software, you may have to purchase expensive servers
                                and workstations. Often, the software vendor will then require you to send them
                                the server to install the system, or make you buy the server through them in the
                                first place, all with additional charges. With FreightEasy, you don’t have to buy
                                a new hardware system; a huge savings for your company, in both time and money.

                                those who are working with a fixed I.T. budget. Customer support, maintenance, and

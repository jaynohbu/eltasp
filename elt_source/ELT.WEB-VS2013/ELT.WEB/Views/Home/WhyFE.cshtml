                                Using FreightEasy AES, you can submit SED information through a web link to the

                                FreightEasy requires no software installations. Software installations are costly,
                                time consuming may require skillful I.T. professionals. Traditional software solutions
                                also require on-going maintenance and upgrades. Sometimes installed software can
                                cause conflicts and create problems, hurting your bottom line. FreightEasy eliminates
                                these potential issues.

                                With traditional LAN based software, you may have to purchase expensive servers
                                and workstations. Often, the software vendor will then require you to send them
                                the server to install the system, or make you buy the server through them in the
                                first place, all with additional charges. With FreightEasy, you don’t have to buy
                                a new hardware system; a huge savings for your company, in both time and money.

                                Many software vendors charge per-transaction fees or per-user fees. In addition,
                                some software vendors charge you for upgrades and technical support. Our flat monthly
                                fee is just that: flat. There are no hidden charges, which makes it perfect for
                                those who are working with a fixed I.T. budget. Customer support, maintenance, and
                                upgrades are all included in this price. Additionally, our startup fee is much less
                                than most other systems.</p>
